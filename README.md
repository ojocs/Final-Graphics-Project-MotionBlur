We use the open-gl tutorial code as a base for our project, found here http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/download/.

We are also implementing based off of the implementation here https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/
part-iv-image-effects/chapter-27-motion-blur-post-processing-effect

Our work is done in the playground directory.


INSTRUCTIONS:

To compile, use cmake-gui. Put "Final-Graphics-Project" as the source, and "Final-Graphics-Project/build" as 
the build.
Then click Configure and Generate. Open the Tutorials.sln executable in the "build" directory.
Once Visual Studio loads, set the playground directory as the startup directory.
Then build it inside VS.
Lastly, go to the playground and start the playground directory executable.
