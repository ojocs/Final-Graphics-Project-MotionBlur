We use the open-gl tutorial code as a base for our project, found here http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/download/.

We are also implementing based off of the implementation here https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/
part-iv-image-effects/chapter-27-motion-blur-post-processing-effect

Our work is done in the "../tutorial14_render_to_texture" directory.


INSTRUCTIONS:

To compile, use cmake-gui. Put "../Final-Graphics-Project" as the source, and "../Final-Graphics-Project/build" as 
the build.
Then click Configure and Generate. Open the Tutorials.sln executable in the "../Final-Graphics-Project/build" directory.
Once Visual Studio loads, set the "tutorial14_render_to_texture" directory as the startup directory.
Then build it inside VS.
Lastly, go to the "../tutorial14_render_to_texture" directory and run "tutorial14_render_to_texture.exe".
